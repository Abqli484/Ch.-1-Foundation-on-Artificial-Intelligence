# Chapter 1: Foundations on Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains team-based assignments focusing on foundational AI concepts, including programming, data analysis, and visualization. The tasks are designed to develop a deeper understanding through hands-on applications using real-world data.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Cash Denomination Calculation (01_Kelompok_J_2.ipynb)
This notebook presents a Python solution to calculate Indonesian currency denominations for a given balance, considering the available banknotes and coins.

#### Key Features:
- **Input Validation:** Ensures the balance is an integer within the range of Rp 0 to Rp 1000000000.
- **Denomination Calculation:** Prioritizes larger denominations and computes the quantity of each banknote and coin needed.
- **Output:** Displays a breakdown of the banknotes and coins, showing total counts and any residual balance.

### 2. Data Analysis & Visualization (01_Kelompok_J_3.ipynb)
This notebook analyzes an HR dataset to uncover key insights through various data analyses and visualizations, such as salary distribution, termination reasons, and performance scores.

#### Key Analyses:
- **Salary Statistics by Marital Status and Gender:** Compute salary stats (min, median, max, average) by gender and marital status.
- **Top-5 Reasons for Termination:** Identifies the most common reasons for employee termination.
- **Performance by Recruitment Source:** Analyzes the relationship between recruitment sources and performance scores.
- **Manager Count by Department:** Counts unique managers in each department.
- **Termination Ratio by Gender:** Compares termination ratios between genders.

#### Key Visualizations:
- **Termination Ratio by Gender:** Bar chart comparing termination rates by gender.
- **Salary vs. Engagement Survey:** Scatter plot with colors indicating termination status.
- **Terminations by Department:** Bar chart showing terminations across departments.
- **Termination Percentages by Position:** Pie chart illustrating termination percentages by position.
- **Salary Distribution by Marital Status and Termination Status:** Boxplot of salary distributions by marital and termination status.
- **Relationship Analysis:** Pairplot of key metrics (e.g., salary, engagement, satisfaction, absences) segmented by termination status.

## Running the Notebooks

1. Open **Google Colab**.
2. Upload the `.ipynb` files (01_Kelompok_J_2.ipynb and 01_Kelompok_J_3.ipynb) to Colab.
3. For the **01_Kelompok_B_3.ipynb** notebook, ensure the HR dataset is accessible (either via the provided URL or by uploading the dataset directly).
